to set a folder as git repo
just run in terminal git init
and then run git remote add origin (git@github.com:ujju23/git_Git.git)
after origin I hae gien the path of github repo where i want to push and pulls



when you are creating a new folder and want to make it git repo----
git init  ( run this code on terminal for that folder )
now you can do git add, git commit , git diff and many more thins just apart from git push and pulls
beacuse its a local repo right now not a remote one

if you want to make it a remote repo
git remote add origin git@github.com:ujju23/gits.git ( after origin i hae gien the remote address, 
unique for eery repo)   
git branch -M main ( this is to remoe master and add main coz eerthing will done on main)
git push -u origin main
