added with designs
when you are creating a new folder and want to make it git repo----

1.git init  ( run this code on terminal for that folder )

now you can do git add, git commit , git diff and many more thins just apart from git push and pulls
beacuse its a local repo right now not a remote one

if you want to make it a remote repo----

1.git remote add origin git@github.com:ujju23/gits.git ( after origin i hae gien the remote address, 
unique for eery repo)   
2.git branch -M main ( this is to remoe master and add main coz eerthing will done on main)
3.git push -u origin main
